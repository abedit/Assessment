# Simple Coin List & Details App

This is a simple coin list app as I wanted to test the dependency injection using Hilt and the Navigation component with Compose.

A brief summary of the app:

- Upon clicking on an list item, display more details about the Coin
- The data are to be refresh automatically every 60 seconds
